#Accessing Elements of Lists

#Lists are numbered starting from zero:
# the first element is animals[0]

#to programmers, a list is more like a deck of cards

# ORDINAL == ORDERED (1ST = 1ST)
# CARDINAL == CARDS AT RANDOM, 0

#If he says "fist", "second" and so on, he means ordinal, so subtract one

animals = ['bear', 'python3.6', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

print(animals[1])
